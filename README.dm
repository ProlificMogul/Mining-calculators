Welcome
I'm Munyaradzi Mutyaso. 
I'm a mining engineer by profession. I'm also a self-taught full-stack web developer. Below are the tools I use in my mining engineering work. I created them to make my calculations easier rather than punching the calculator every time I want to calculate net present value or airflow rate in drives, etc. You may find them useful too.
